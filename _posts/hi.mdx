title: Start Programming :) but where to start :(*)
description: There are substantial amount of young youths that are getting interested in programming. Here are my insights about the topic.

## Why do you want to start Coding.

---

I mean don't get me wrong I like the idea of someone starting to code and understand technology in general
but usually people get into it not knowing why they are doing it, some might start because some one do it others well cause it looks cool.
am not saying one is cool and the others are not but doing it to impress people or for others pleasure in what so ever way is not going to last, neither is that a good cause.If you are doing this because this is cool or you think its interesting i think that is enough, you don't have to had like a story to choose why you started coding. But make sure you are doing it for you.

## OK, so where should I start tho ?

If you are a student i mean you can learn stuff online but one of the biggest would be to enroll in computer science or a related fields. But most of us want to get started as fast as possible, world is moving too fast. So this is where the resources on the internet seem overwhelming. Usually one of the biggest fears for people getting into programming is that if they are studing the right language or if they are doing it the right way.

For me its just better to start from the fundamentals from one book or two. Let's try not to rush and write a code that can hack Nasa. Let's start small understand what computers are, what are they made of , what is programming. This very basic quations are the one that can take you a distance if you answer them properly. But usually nobody wants to study those people are busy getting confused trying to write a code they don't understand.
** Take your time to understand the Basics**

`Take Your time to understand the Basics!`

## What are the basics?

The Basic starts off with what a computer is. Understanding a computer is the basic of learning programming. Understanding The basic of computer works to what a memory is to learning how memory allocation works will help you understand your code better.
Beyond that diving into what a computer program is would start by understanding algorithm. **a computer program is just an algorithm that is meant to be for computers.**. you can kick this off with the basic understanding of algorithms. understanding flow charts can be the kick off.
