title: Our thoughts on software development in Ethiopia
description: Software Development in Ethiopia seems to be taking shpe recently, we have a lot of software made for the public and a lot of start-ups are making a softwares everywhere.

Software can't be developed with a couple of people and be a better one, we need to have more people that develops and wite test for the software but when you limit the number of people who
get involved in the process the development might not cover the whole process which might not produce a desired software at the end of the tunnel.

On this blog we will try to discuss about our opinion on software development in Ethiopia. If you prefer a podcast instead of a blog post you can listen to
our episode [here](https://zemachfm.com/podcast/software-development-in-ethiopia-our-opinions/)

## How many apps did you have installed on your phone right now that are built in Ethiopia.

How many applictions you have installed on your phone or you desktop ( this might be rare ). How good are they did they do what they say they would do ? How do they fell compered to other apps you have on your phone
for me i have a couple of applictions made in Ethiopia that i have installed on my phone , well for the question i would say there are a lot of good applications that i use usually and some of them might be telegram bots, but still
there are also apps that are not that good or some that doesn't even do what they said. we will talk in detail what the problem they might have, at least we can relate to these apps that we have expected so much of but didn't live up to the hype.

## starting from the strength

well some apps are just great we will talk about development later on but for the most part what make an application great is the fact that it do what it is supposed to do you know no surprise crashes and when it does at least gives you some info 
how to solve that problem if it can be solved. for example if you put a number in the name field when signing up the app should just be crashing or saying something went wrong , it should specifically tell you what you can improve in this case tell you to 
correct your input when entering your name.This can be expanded quite a lot , generally **give the user the feedback they deserve.**

But some apps do what they say they would but might confuse you in the process these are usually the **Bad UI/UX** experience .Those apps might work but its always a hustle to get what you want even if you can do that. some of these apps **Hide** some functionality somewhere
or they don't make it stright forward, have you ever seen something that looks like a button but its not clickable or doesn't take you no where, when *your expectation was shattered* that shows there might be a UX problem we are dealing with.
there are a lot of apps that violate those good rules of a good app so they might be considered not so good but we always appreciate the effort and we understand the software development in Ethiopia is just starting and what we already have is to be grown rather than being shattered 
so we appreciate the effort and urges development personnel and companies to aim for more!

In simple terms, an app should have a good user centered interface and should work, it should fulfuil the expectation of the user while claiming this any app goes through a process to get to the users hand, this process vary from company to company develper to developer but there are an agreed up on
process that people usually follow to develop the app it goes like this
- you have an idea
- you analyze it and determine what needs to be done
- you start thinking about the idea and changing it to the software
- you analyze the software parts and components that are going to made the app
- you start making your app
- you might need to get back and correct some issues in the process
- finish up and test the application itself ( you might want to test the idea before starting the app itself)
- get it out there and let the target user use it :)

in this process of making your idea a reality most of the development happens after you start thinking about how you can make your idea a software. then the development start til you test it and iterate if you are not comfortable with the test result
so we will discuss one of the biggest issues in the process.

## Are playing a Copy Cat or do you have an idea ?

One of the biggest problem starts with the idea. Usually ideas start from a problem but sometimes ideas might be just copied because they work in some area, now this might work sometimes especially in a similar enviroments but **playing a copy cat** is not a way to do it, basically because they don't usually work.

## Software development problems

Most of the problems we mentioned in the intro about using some apps relay monstly in the development process or in the design phase , since we downloaded those apps thinking they have a good idea, if you are like me you don't download you are not going to use. Those apps we thought we can use might not be well built starting from
the interface to the overall experience.which usually orginate from software development process.

one of the major problem in software developments

- Lack of development time
- Lack of developers
- Lack of experience
- Lack of real feedback

most of the issues we face are not problem that arise from the software developer usually software develoeprs are forced to push a product in a restricted time with out any test or limted test. usaully the problem arise from the way the product owner think about software and how its done.
